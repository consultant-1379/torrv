Site Engineering Documents Repository
--------------------------------------

This repository exists to minimize the amount of time spent searching for the most up-to-date SEDs and
other files for a particular deployment. It is the responsibility of the team to keep it up to date 
and to remove old and unnecessary documents.

NOTE: 
There is no guarantee that these files are always up-to-date, if in doubt the last commit message
will show who pushed the latest copy. 
If you have any corrections made to a local SED please update the copy on the server. i.e. delete and push the new copy
